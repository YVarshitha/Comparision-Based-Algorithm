2.Then enter the input range (e.g. 1000, 2000, 4000, 5000, 10,000 ...) in the output terminal.

3.The result of sorting can be viewed once the input range is specified.

4.The execution times for sorting of random array, sorted array and reverse sorted array for all the five algorithms are displayed.
